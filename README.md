# Computer Graphics: Manifold
This project uses the p5.js library to render a 3-Dimensional Manifold in the browser.
I recommend downloading a p5 extension in Visual Studio Code.
In the "f" function of the sketch.js file, declare variable "equation" as a scalar function of 
a 3D array r. And start up a browser to let it do its thing. 

## Initiatives
- We need to update the diffuse lighting so it actually works
- We need to add specular lighting
- Currently, light is only traced from the camera, but if we want shadows, we ought to implement it for the actual lights, as well.
